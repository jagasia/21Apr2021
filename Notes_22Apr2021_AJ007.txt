Demos needed in this session:
------------------------------
Data manipulation language
	manipulation means, the data in the database is getting affected.
		INSERTing
		UPDATE
		DELETE

	all these DML operations are done on the records inside the table.

Manipulation should not be confused with:
		ALTERing the table (alter means, the structure of the table gets affected)

	similarly,
		DROPping a table means, removing the table itself from the database. That is
		not to be confused with DELETE (DELETE means remove only records in the table NOT THE TABLE)

CREATE		to create table
ALTER		(PENDING)
DROP		(PENDING)
TRUNCATE	(PENDING)
	these are data definition language.

INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE
	These are data manipulation language.

we learnt to insert a row(s) into the table yesterday.
	a single row
	multiple rows using ,
	multiple rows using sub query 	(SELECT)

today,
we are going to learn UPDATE
UPDATE?
	a row or multiple or all rows can be updated using UPDATE statement

	UPDATE TABLENAME SET COLNAME=VALUE, COLNAME=VALUE,....	WHERE CONDITION

	this is the syntax for UPDATE statement in SQL
	If we did not give WHERE condition, then all the rows present in the table will be updated. (DANGEROUS)

	if we give a condition that none of rows are satisfied, then NO ROWS are updated.

	UPDATE BRANCH SET BCITY='Kolkata' WHERE BID='B00012';
	UPDATE BRANCH SET BCITY='Vishakapatnam', BNAME='Rani street' WHERE BID='B00014';
	UPDATE BRANCH SET BCITY='UNKNOWN';			--there is no where condition (all rows will be affected)



    UPDATE BRANCH SET BCITY=(SELECT BCITY FROM BRANCH WHERE BID='B00006') WHERE BID='B00014';

UPDATE BRANCH SET BCITY='New Delhi' WHERE BCITY='Delhi';
	the above query is based on non primary key column as condition. so it may affect 0 or more rows

delete:
--------
	we can remove row(s) from the table using 
	DELETE statement
	
	if we did not give any condition, then all the rows in the table will be deleted.
	DELETE SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH DROP TABLE STATEMENT

	

	DELETE FROM CUSTOMER_COPY WHERE CUSTID='C00010';	
		this is delete using primary key columne. since primary key has unique values, a delete using primary key will delete 0 or 1 records
		
	DELETE FROM CUSTOMER_COPY WHERE city='Delhi';
		here, the condition is using non key column. So, the delete operation may delete 0 or more records

	DELETE FROM CUSTOMER_COPY WHERE 1=2;
		HERE, the condition is false, so no records are deleted

	DELETE FROM CUSTOMER_COPY;
		HERE, no condition, hence all rows in the table are deleted

insert into customer_copy
select * from customer;		//i have added all the 10 records from customer table to customer_copy


TRUNCATE customer_copy;		//TRUNCATE always remove all records from the table. WE CANNOT SPECIFY A CONDITION for TRUNCATE. so there is no choice to remove selective records using TRUNCATE.
	In fact, TRUNCATE is a DDL (Data Definition Language) So it drops the table and creates again (so fast when compared to DELETE statement)

TRUNCATE CANNOT BE ROLLED BACK	(Because, TRUNCATE is DDL. a ddl statement can never be rolled back)

so, please do research on difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE

We have completed Data Manipulation Language
